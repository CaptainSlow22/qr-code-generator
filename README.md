A QR Code Generator application created using the Spring Boot framework and Thymeleaf templating engine. <br/>
•I utilized the ZXing (Zebra Crossing) library to generate QR codes based on user inputs. <br/>
•I deployed it seamlessly using a custom Docker image pushed to Docker Hub. <br/>
This project aimed to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for generating QR codes with embedded
information. <br/>
